# How anybody can predict Airbnb ratings... ðŸ˜²

...or at least try to predict it ðŸ˜…

During my data science course with Udacity I was challenged to predict something
with public data from Airbnb. Because I'm currently travel in Australia, I
chooses to use all public available data from the land of the kangaroos ðŸ¦˜ -
thanks at this point to [Inside Airbnb](https://www.insideairbnb.com/)
who provides the data.

Before we dive into the prediction model, let's start with some insights
about the amenities data of the Airbnb accommodations.

## What are the most common amenities in Australia?

This one you might have expected - it is a kitchen. Roughly 92% of the
accommodations offers a kitchen. Second comes the smoke alarm with around 91% -
hopefully the missing 9% are explainable just because the owners forgot to
mention it.

The picture above shows the Top-20 amenities. Which of them do you find
surprising? Or do you miss something?
